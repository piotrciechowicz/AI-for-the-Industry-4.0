AI for the Industry 4.0

Model to predict characteristics of a working sensor in water and isopropanol based on measured characteristics in air.

Dataset:
Collection of measurements based on 10 sensors in three reference substances: Air, Water, Isopropanol.
Dataset contains two-dimensional signal (signal wavelength, signal amplitude).

Four machine learning models have been created:     

- Linear Regression
- MultiTaskElasticNetCV
- Random Forest Regressor
- KNeighborsRegressor

The best results were obtained for Random Forest Regressor.

Libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn
